## What is [SNS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS).

Unline SQS where we were polling for messages (remember we were clicking on poll!), here we push out messages to subscribers. This is called push-based messaging. The publisher sends message to SNS topic and subscribers get notified proactively when there's a message. No action is needed from subscribers' part.
