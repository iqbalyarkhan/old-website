Deque data structure
<!-- end-->

### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a data structure called **deque**. Deque, or double ended queue, is a data structure that is similar to [stacks](/post/stacks) and [queues](/post/queue) but has an added advantage where you can add and remove items from both ends. Having said that, we'll be looking at how to implement one from scratch although C++ has an [implementation](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/deque/) for it. We'll look at functions such as `pushLeft()`, `pushRight()`, `popLeft()` and `popRight()`. As the names suggest, pushing will be for adding elements to our deque and popping will be for item removal. Let's get started.

### Code

```cpp{numberLines}
#ifndef Deque_h
#define Deque_h

#include "Node.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
struct DoublyNode{
    DoublyNode<T>* next;
    DoublyNode<T>* prev;
    T element;
};

template <typename T>
class Deque{
private:
    DoublyNode<T>* head;
    DoublyNode<T>* tail;
    int size;
    
public:
    Deque();
    ~Deque();
    int getSize();
    void pushLeft(T elem);
    void pushRight(T elem);
    T popLeft();
    T popRight();
    void print();
};

template <typename T>
Deque<T>::Deque(){
    size = 0;
    head = nullptr;
    tail = nullptr;
}

template <typename T>
int Deque<T>::getSize(){
    return size;
}

template <typename T>
void Deque<T>::pushLeft(T elem){
    DoublyNode<T>* newNode = new DoublyNode<T>;
    newNode->element = elem;
    newNode->next = nullptr;
    newNode->prev = nullptr;
    if (size == 0){
        head = newNode;
        tail = newNode;
    } else {
        
        newNode->next = head;
        newNode->prev = nullptr;
        head->prev = newNode;

    } else {
        tail->next = newNode;
        newNode->prev = tail;
        tail = newNode;
    }
    size++;
}

template <typename T>
T Deque<T>::popRight(){
    T elem = -1;
    if (size == 0){
        return elem;
    } else if (size == 1){
        elem = head->element;
        delete head;
        delete tail;
        head = nullptr;
        tail = nullptr;
    }else {
        DoublyNode<T>* newHead = head->next;
        elem = head->element;
        delete head;
        head = newHead;
        head->prev = nullptr;
    }
    size--;
    return elem;
}

template <typename T>
T Deque<T>::popLeft(){
    T elem = -1;
    if (size == 0){
        return elem;
    } else if (size == 1) {
        elem = head->element;
        delete head;
        delete tail;
        head = nullptr;
        tail = nullptr;
    }else {
        DoublyNode<T>* newTail = tail->prev;
        elem = tail->element;
        delete tail;
        tail = newTail;
        tail->next = nullptr;
    }
    size--;
    return elem;
}

template <typename T>
void Deque<T>::print(){
    DoublyNode<T>* temp = head;
    while (temp != 0){
        cout << temp->element << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

template <typename T>
Deque<T>::~Deque(){
    DoublyNode<T>* temp = head->next;
    while(temp != 0){
        cout << "Deleting: " << head->element << " ";
        delete head;
        head = nullptr;
        head = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << "Finally deleted: " << head->element;
    delete head;
    head = nullptr;
    tail = nullptr;
    cout << endl;
}

#endif /* Deque_h */

```

### Explanation

The code is quite simple. The only new thing we've done now is that we've got a **doubly linked list**. In a doubly linked list, there is an additional pointer to the previous element. This is required for a deque since if we're removing an element from the tail, we need to be able to re-assign tail to its previous element. We don't necessarily need it to be a doubly linked list and can easily iterate over the list to find where the second to last element is before removing the last element but that would, obviously, increase our time complexity. However, a doubly linked list takes up more space since for each node that we add to our list, we're adding two more pointers which takes up more space.

Other than the caveat discussed, the code is nothing new. `popLeft()` and `pushLeft()` remove and add elements respectively from the "start" of the deque while the `popRight()` and `pushRight()` perform similar operations on the opposite end of the deque. Here are the time complexities:

Insertion at either end: $O(1)$

Removal from either end: $O(1)$

Search: $O(N)$
