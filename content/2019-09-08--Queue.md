### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a very common data structure called queue. The idea behind queue is simple. As the name suggests, it represents a data structure where elements are processed in the order they're received: **first in first out** or FIFO. Common operations supported by a queue data structure would be **Enqueue** (adding to end of queue - akin to someone getting in line), **Dequeue** (removing from front of queue - someone being processed from our line), **Print** (to print our queue), and **GetSize** (to get size of our queue). We'll be using an implementation of my LinkedList class that I described in [this](/post/linked-lists#code) section.

### Code

```cpp{numberLines}
#ifndef Queue_h
#define Queue_h

#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
struct Node{
    T element;
    Node* next;
};

template<typename T>
class Queue{
private:
    Node<T>* head;
    Node<T>* tail;
    int size;
    
public:
    Queue();
    ~Queue();
    void Print();
    
    T Dequeue();
    void Enqueue(T num);
    
    int GetSize();
};

//Constructor that initializes our head and tail pointers
//and sets our size to 0.
template<typename T>
Queue<T>::Queue(){
    head = nullptr;
    tail = nullptr;
    size = 0;
}

//Destructor to clean up our list
template<typename T>
Queue<T>::~Queue(){
    Node<T>* curr = head;
    while (curr != 0){
        Node<T>* temp = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
        delete temp;
        temp = curr;
    }
    head = nullptr;
    tail = nullptr;
    
}

//Function to print our queue starting at head
template<typename T>
void Queue<T>::Print(){
    Node<T>* itr = head;
    while(itr != 0){
        std::cout << itr->element << " ";
        itr = itr->next;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

//Function to enqueue: insert at end
template<typename T>
void Queue<T>::Enqueue(T num){
    Node<T>* n = new Node<T>;
    n->element = num;
    n->next = nullptr;
    
    if (size == 0){
        head = n;
        tail = n;
        size++;
    } else {
        tail->next = n;
        tail = n;
        size++;
    }
}

//Function to remove from head of queue
template<typename T>
T Queue<T>::Dequeue(){
    Node<T>* temp = head;
    head = head->next;
    
    temp->next = nullptr;
    T element = temp->element;
    delete temp;
    size--;
    return element;
}

template<typename T>
int Queue<T>::GetSize(){
    return size;
}
#endif /* Queue_h */
```

### Explanation

Code is quite simple to understand. Let's start with the the `Enqueue` function:

```cpp{numberLines:65}
//Function to enqueue: insert at end
template<typename T>
void Queue<T>::Enqueue(T num){
    Node<T>* n = new Node<T>;
    n->element = num;
    n->next = nullptr;
    
    if (size == 0){
        head = n;
        tail = n;
        size++;
    } else {
        tail->next = n;
        tail = n;
        size++;
    }
}
```

This function is exactly the same as `InsertAtTail` function in my LinkedList post. All we're doing here is adding a new element to the end of the queue. Once inserted, we increment the size of the queue and update our `tail` pointer.


Let's have a look at our `Dequeue` function:
```cpp{numberLines:83}
//Function to remove from head of queue
template<typename T>
T Queue<T>::Dequeue(){
    Node<T>* temp = head;
    head = head->next;
    
    temp->next = nullptr;
    T element = temp->element;
    delete temp;
    size--;
    return element;
}
```

Here, we're removing an element from the front of the queue, decrementing the size of our queue and updating the `head` pointer. One thing to note here is that we're also freeing up the memory that was being used by the node. The `Dequeue` function returns the value held in the node so we save the value in the `element` variable before returning to the calling function. 

Each of the two functions above keep track of our private `size` variable that is then returned whenever the client calls our `GetSize()` method.

### Analysis

Insertion into a queue takes $O(1)$ time and so does deletion. That is because we've got pointers to both the head (for removal) and tail (for insertion). 


### STL Queue
Ofcourse, STL comes equipped with a queue implementation. It is part of the `queue` header. Here's a simple demo of the library:

```cpp
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    queue<int> myQ;
    myQ.push(11);
    myQ.push(10);
    myQ.push(9);
    myQ.push(8);
    cout << myQ.front() << endl; //11
    cout << myQ.back() << endl;//8
    myQ.pop(); //Removes 11 from front of queue
    cout << myQ.front() << endl;//10
    return 0;
}
```

### STL Deque

The C++ STL comes with another container known as deque (pronounced as deck) or double ended queue. This container allows you to push to front, push to back, pop front and pop back:

```cpp
    deque<int> dq;
    dq.push_back(1);
    dq.push_front(2);
    dq.pop_back();
    dq.pop_front();
```

To iterate over elements in a deque, we can use a simple for loop similar to how you'd print a vector


### Conclusion

The code is quite simple once you get the hang of pointers. It is better if you draw out what's going in the `Enqueue` and `Dequeue` functions. We'll be building on top of the [`LinkedList`](/post/linked-lists#code) again when we talk about another data structure called stack.
