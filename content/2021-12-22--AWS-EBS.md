## What is [EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html)?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.

Amazon EBS should be used for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.

## Features

You create an EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone, and then attach it to an instance in that same Availability Zone. Your snapshots are automatically replicated in the AZ where you created the volume. To make a volume available outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot (backup) and restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in that Region. You can copy snapshots to other Regions and then restore them to new volumes there, making it easier to leverage multiple AWS Regions for geographical expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery.

You can create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, which are persisted to Amazon S3. Snapshots protect data for long-term durability, and they can be used as the starting point for new EBS volumes. The same snapshot can be used to instantiate as many volumes as you wish. These snapshots can be copied across AWS Regions.

## Volume Types
Amazon EBS provides the following volume types: General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, and Cold HDD. 

**Side Note**: *IOPS = speed, Throughput = amount*

## General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3)

General purpose volumes  balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional workloads. These volumes are ideal for use cases such as boot volumes, medium-size single instance databases, and development and test environments.

Use cases include:

- GP2:
    - Good for **boot volumes** or development and test applications that are not latency sensitive

-GP3:
    - Good for high performance at a low cost (MySQL, Cassandra, Virtual desktop, hadoop etc)

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2)
IOPS SSD volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. They provide a consistent IOPS rate that you specify when you create the volume. This enables you to predictably scale to tens of thousands of IOPS per instance. Additionally, io2 volumes provide the highest levels of volume durability.

Use cases include:

- io1:
    - Designed for I/O intensive apps, large DBs and latency sentisive workloads
    - **Use this if you need high performance AND more than 16,000 IOPS**

- io2:
    - Higher durability and more IOPS than io1

## Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
These volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather than IOPS. These volumes are ideal for large, sequential workloads such as Amazon EMR, ETL, data warehouses, and log processing.

- st1:
    - Low cost HDD volume
    - Used for frequently accessed throughput intensive workloads
    - Big data, data warehouse, ETL, log processing etc
    - **CANNOT BE A BOOT VOLUME!**

## Cold HDD volumes (sc1) 

These volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather than IOPS. These volumes are ideal for large, sequential, cold-data workloads. If you require infrequent access to your data and are looking to save costs, these volumes provides inexpensive block storage.

- sc1:
    - Cheapest! 
    - Good for colder data requiring fewer scans per day. 
    - Good for apps that need the lowest cost and performance is not a factor
    - **CANNOT BE A BOOT VOLUME!**
