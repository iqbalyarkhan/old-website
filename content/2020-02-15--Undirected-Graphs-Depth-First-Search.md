### Introduction

One of the questions most frequently asked about graphs is some variant of the following:
- Is there a path from A to B?
- What is the shortest path from A to B? (Either in terms of number of hops, or distances or costs which may be stored on edges.)
- What is the distance from A to every other node in the graph (or every node that can be reached from A)?

All of these problems fall under the broad area of graph search or computation of shortest paths (or just paths). These problems have many important applications:

- Finding fast or cheap ways to go from one place to another, by utilizing road networks (optimizing distance or time), or airline or train networks (optimizing time or cost).
- Finding social distance in a social network.

A lot of real-world problems are extremely naturally modeled as shortest path searches in suitably defined graphs. There are plenty of follow up questions that can be asked when we're talking about graph search:

- Do we just want to know whether a path exists, or do we need to find it?
- If we need to find a path, do we want the shortest path, or will any path do?
- If we donâ€™t need to find it, do we need the exact distance between nodes, or just whether a path exists? 
- Do edges have lengths/costs associated with them, or are we just interested in the number of hops.
- If edges have costs associated with them, can they be negative?

Let's start with an algorithm that'll help us answer the question **whether a path exists from A to B**:

### Depth First Search

The idea behind depth first search is to go as deep down a path as possible until you hit a dead-end and then backtrack your way to the next available path that can be taken. We'll use an algorithm called, **depth first search** to do so:

```cpp{numberLines:true}

void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(){
    for (int i = 0; i < visited.size(); i++){
        if (!visited[i]){
            RecursiveDFS(i);
        }
    }
}

void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList[v].size(); i++){
        int curr = adjList[v][i];
        if (!visited[curr]){
            RecursiveDFS(curr);
        }
    }
}
```

The first function iterates over the `visited` array to make sure we've visited all the vertices (this `visited` array will come in handy in later posts as well). For each unvisited vertex, it calls the second `RecursiveDFS(int v)` function that then visits that vertex's unvisited neighbors.

This function allows us to pass in any vertex you want and it'll print out all the vertices that can be reached from the passed vertex. The logic behind this function is this:

- Take in the passed vertex and mark the vertex in array, `visited` to true. This array is an [instance variable (bound to the instance of the class)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable) for the class. 
- Once the vertex is marked, print the vertex and iterate through the current vertex's adjacency list.
- In this list, if the `curr` vertex is not visited, call the function again with this new, un-visited vertex.

Let's step through this logic using this graph as an example:

### Finding Paths Using DFS

We've discussed algorithms for searching (BFS and DFS) but these algorithms can be modified slightly to answer more questions that we asked in the graph search section. Specifically, we're usually interested in answering questions such as **Is there a path from A to B and if so what is it?**. There is a surprisingly simple way to answer that question using DFS:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList[v].size(); i++){
        int curr = adjList[v][i];
        if (!visited[curr]){
            edgeTo[curr] = v;
            RecursiveDFS(curr);
        }
    }
}
```
Only addition we've made to DFS from earlier is that we've now got a new array called `edgeTo` which is equal to the size of the vertices in our graph (we initialized it in the constructor). Next, whenever we find an unvisited edge in a vertex's adjacency list, we're going to that index in the `edgeTo` array and populating that index with the value `v`. This helps us keep a note of what vertex we used to get to the current vertex, ie, what is the predecessor vertex to the current vertex that was used to get to the current vertex. Let's walk through an example:

Initially our `edgeTo` list is empty. Assume we've got 6 vertices labelled 0-5 in our graph:

```
edgeTo[0] = ___
edgeTo[1] = ___
edgeTo[2] = ___
edgeTo[3] = ___
edgeTo[4] = ___
edgeTo[5] = ___
``` 

and this is our graph:

![Undirected-Graph-1](images/graphs/path1.png) [Image Credit - Undirected Graph 1](https://graphonline.ru/en/)

and this is our adjacency list for the corresponding graph:

```
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
4 -> 2 -> 3
5 -> 0 -> 3
```

Let's say we start at vertex 0 so initially `edgeTo[0]` would equal 0. Next we look at 2 in 0's adjacency list so `curr` would equal 2. 2 is unvisited so we go inside the `if` statement in the function and mark `edgeTo[curr]` to `v`. `v` initially is 0 so `edgeTo[2] = 0`:

```
edgeTo[0] = ___
edgeTo[1] = ___
edgeTo[2] = 0
edgeTo[3] = ___
edgeTo[4] = ___
edgeTo[5] = ___
``` 
In essence, `edgeTo[curr] = v` means that the edge `v - curr` was taken (or `0 - 2` in the example above) to visit `curr` for the first time. When we're done with all the edges, this is what `edgeTo` would look like:

```
edgeTo[0] = 0
edgeTo[1] = 2
edgeTo[2] = 0
edgeTo[3] = 2
edgeTo[4] = 3
edgeTo[5] = 3
```

The `edgeTo` array allows us to capture the vertex that was taken to get to `edgeTo[curr]` vertex. How do we actually transform this information to something useful? For example, **what was the path taken to get to vertex 5 from vertex 0?** To do so, we need to follow the path information stored in `edgeTo` array. For example, to get to 5 (let's say 5 is our `w`) from 0 (let's say 0 is our `v`) we can step through the array like so:

```
Begin at the w vertex: 5
Check edgeTo[endVertex] = edgeTo[5] = 3.
Go to edgeTo[3] = 2
Go to edgeTo[2] = 0
We're now at v vertex: 0
```

This algorithm builds a path in time proportional to the number of vertices visited. Worst case, we need to go through all the vertices therefore the run time is $O(N)$.

Notice how in the algorithm above we've got the vertex trace but we need to print the trace in reverse order, ie last in first out: the algorithm went in this order`5 3 2 0` but the actual path we took was `0 2 3 5`. Since the nature of our output is LIFO, we can use a stack and keep pushing to our stack as we visit each vertex in the algorithm above:

```
Begin at the w vertex: 5 (push 5 on the stack)
Check edgeTo[endVertex] = edgeTo[5] = 3. (push 3 on the stack)
Go to edgeTo[3] = 2 (push 2 on the stack)
Go to edgeTo[2] = 0 (push 0 on the stack)
We're now at v vertex: 0

Stack:
  0
  2
  3
  5
_____

```

We can now pop elements off the stack and print them to get our actual path. Here's the code for this logic:

```cpp{numberLines:true}
void AdjList::FindPath(int v, int w){
    /**
     Begin at the w vertex: 5 (push 5 on the stack)
     Check edgeTo[w] = edgeTo[5] = 3. (push 3 on the stack)
     Go to edgeTo[3] = 2 (push 2 on the stack)
     Go to edgeTo[2] = 0 (push 0 on the stack)
     We're now at v vertex: 0
     */
    stack<int> s;
    int end = w;
    while (true){
        s.push(end);
        if (end == v){
            break;
        }
        end = edgeTo[end];
    }
    
    cout << "Path from " << v << " to " << w <<": "<<endl;
    while (!s.empty()) {
        cout << s.top() << " ";
         s.pop();
    }
    
    cout << endl;
}
```

### Breadth First Search

Notice how depth first search took a long route to find the path from 0 to 5 in the section above. That is because DFS is not designed to find the shortest route. It is used to find **a** route. Therefore, DFS helped us answer whether a path existed, BFS will help us find the shortest path from the starting node. 

In breadth first search, we start the search from elements closest to the starting node. The only difference between the code for depth first and breadth first is that breadth first uses `queue` instead of `stack`. The algorithm has 3 main steps:

- Remove a vertex from the queue
- Mark all vertices adjacent to current vertex and push them onto the queue
- Repeat until queue is empty

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::BFS(int v){
    vector<int> marked(vectorSize);
    queue<int> q;
    marked[v] = true;
    q.push(v);
    while (!q.empty()){
        int curr = q.front();
        cout << curr << " ";
        q.pop();
        for (int i = 0; i < adjList[curr].size(); i++){
            int neighbor = adjList[curr][i];
            if (!marked[neighbor]){
                edgeTo[neighbor] = curr;
                marked[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```
 The code above first creates a boolean vector to keep track of visited elements called `marked`.
 
 We also create a queue to push elements so that we can visit them later. We want first in first out for breadth first search because we want to explore all the nodes closest to the starting node first. 

 Next we push the passed element, `v`, onto the queue and mark it. Then we enter a while loop until the queue is empty. 

 We pop an element off the queue, call it `curr`, and start to visit and mark all the elements that are adjacent to `curr`. In the process, we also go ahead and mark these adjacent vertices. This is because we're **visiting** them at this time and this is because BFS is interested in the vertices closest to the passed in vertex. At this point we also populate the `edgeTo` array to record how we got to the current vertex. 
 
We then push each one of these visited vertices onto the queue.

Let's walk through an example again. Here is the graph we're using:

![Undirected-Graph-1](images/graphs/path1.png) [Image Credit - Undirected Graph 1](https://graphonline.ru/en/)

Let's say we start at vertex 0 and our queue is empty and the marked array has each entry as false and edgeTo array is empty:

```
queue:             

marked[0] =        
marked[1] = 
marked[2] = 
marked[3] = 
marked[4] =
marked[5] =  

edgeTo[0] =        
edgeTo[1] = 
edgeTo[2] = 
edgeTo[3] = 
edgeTo[4] = 
edgeTo[5] = 
```
Since we start at 0, we push and mark it:


```
                   current Vertex: 0
queue:                  0

marked[0] =             T
marked[1] = 
marked[2] = 
marked[3] = 
marked[4] =
marked[5] =  

edgeTo[0] =             0
edgeTo[1] = 
edgeTo[2] = 
edgeTo[3] = 
edgeTo[4] = 
edgeTo[5] = 
```

We then go inside the `while` loop, pop 0 from queue, visit all its neighbors, mark them and push them on queue:

```cpp
                   current Vertex: 0
queue:                 2,1,5

marked[0] =             T
marked[1] =             T
marked[2] =             T
marked[3] = 
marked[4] =
marked[5] =             T

edgeTo[0] =             0
edgeTo[1] =             0
edgeTo[2] =             0
edgeTo[3] =     
edgeTo[4] = 
edgeTo[5] =             0
```

Next, we go back to the top of the while loop and pop another element off the queue which is 2:
```cpp
                   current Vertex: 2
queue:                 1,5

marked[0] =             T
marked[1] =             T
marked[2] =             T
marked[3] = 
marked[4] =
marked[5] =             T

edgeTo[0] =             0
edgeTo[1] =             0
edgeTo[2] =             0
edgeTo[3] =     
edgeTo[4] = 
edgeTo[5] =             0
```
We then move through the adjacency list for 2 and mark each vertex and push each to the queue as well:

```cpp
                   current Vertex: 2
queue:                 1,5

marked[0] =             T
marked[1] =             T
marked[2] =             T
marked[3] =             T
marked[4] =             T
marked[5] =             T

edgeTo[0] =             0
edgeTo[1] =             0
edgeTo[2] =             0
edgeTo[3] =             2
edgeTo[4] =             2
edgeTo[5] =             0
```

Although the marking is done and our `edgeTo` array is fully created, the algorithm keeps running until all the elements from the queue are popped off. Notice how the `edgeTo` list now notes that we got to 1,2 and 5 from 0 and we got to 3 and 4 from 2. So if you were to call the `FindPath()` function, it'll provide you with the shortest path from any vertex to any other vertex. 

Notice in DFS we mark a vertex not as soon as we visit it while go through another vertex's adjacency list but it is marked when it is its turn to be popped off the stack. However, in BFS, we mark the element as soon as we visit it while exploring another vertex's adjacency list. 

Similar to DFS, the running time for BFS is also $O(V + E)$.

### BFS vs DFS
When do we choose one over the other? 

**BFS**
Helps us find all the vertices that are one edge away from the starting position, then 2 edges away and so on. BFS, therefore, is to be used when you're looking to find the shortest path to a vertex. 

**DFS**
Helps us actually answer the question whether a path exists between the vertices we're interested in. 

### Connected Components

In graph theory, connected components in an undirected graph are vertices that are connected to each other. The **is connected** relation is an equivalence relation which means:
- Connectivity is reflexive: `v` is connected to `v`
- Connectivity is symmetric: if `v` is connected to `u` then `u`is connected to `v`
- Connectivity is transitive: if `v` is connected to `u` and `u` is connected to `w` then `v` is connected to `w`.

Let's say we have the following graph: 

![Connected Components](images/graphs/connectedcomponents.png) [Image Credit - Connected Components](https://graphonline.ru/en/)

we can say that this graph has 3 components: 

- 0,1,2,3

- 4,5,6,7

- 8,9,10

We want to be able to build a data structure that would answer 3 fundamental questions:
- Are two vertices connected?
- How many components are there in the graph?
- What is the `id` of a vertex? (id is the component number to which the vertex belongs)

To do so, we'll have this approach:

**1.** We'll have an array called components where `components[vertex]` (we'll initialize this array to -1 in the beginning) will be the component number for that vertex. For example, in the image above, let's say

- `0 1 2 3` are in component `0`
- `4 5 6 7` are in component `1`
- `8 9 10` are in component `2` 
    
 The reason we've chosen to initialize the component array to -1 is to keep track of vertex number that still needs to be assigned a component. Once the array is populated, it'll look like this: 
 ```
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3
- - - - - - - - - - - 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

`components[7] = 2` means that vertex 7 belongs to component 2. 

**2.** To create the `components` array, we'll do the following:

- Clear out the `visited` array so that all entries are false. We want this so that we have a marker for those indices that are reachable only from the current vertex. We'll clear this `visited` array on each iteration.
- We'll then call the `DFS(int)` function (or the `BFS(int)` function) to populate the `visited` array.
- Once this function returns, our `visited` array will have some entries set as true, let's say we called `DFS()` with vertex `0` and this is what the `visited` array looked like when the function returned:

```
visited = [T T T T F F F F F F F]
```

We'll iterate over visited array and do the following:

```cpp
componentNumber++;
DFS(curr);
for (int i = 0; i < visited.size(); i++){
    if (visited[i]){
        components[i] = componentNumber;
    }
}
```
`componentNumber` is the variable that'll allow us to keep track of the component number we're on. Once the above loop ends, our `components` array would look like this:

```
1  1  1  1 -1  -1 -1  -1  -1  -1  -1
0  1  2  3  4   5  6   7   8   9  10
```

**3.** We'll call DFS again but this time with the vertex number that has the value -1 in the components array. That is because the value -1 indicates that we haven't figured out the vertices that are connected to the said vertex. We'll repeat the process until there are no more -1s in the components array.

Here's the code:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::FindConnectedComponents(){
    //Initializing the components array:
    vector<int> components(vectorSize, -1);
    //clear out the visited array and set size
    //to number of vertices
    visited.clear();
    visited.resize(vectorSize);
    int curr = 0;
    int componentNumber = 0;
    while (true){
        componentNumber++;
        DFS(curr);
        for (int i = 0; i < visited.size(); i++){
            if (visited[i]){
                components[i] = componentNumber;
            }
        }
        
        curr = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < components.size(); i++){
            if(components[i] == -1){
                curr = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (curr == -1){
            break;
        }
        
        visited.clear();
        visited.resize(vectorSize);
    }
    cout << "Components array: " << endl;
    for (auto j : components){
        cout << j << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

We can now check if `components[v] == components[w]` to see if two components are connected in $O(1)$ time.

### Conclusion

Relationship between objects that can be represented using undirected graphs and a lot of questions can be answered about the said objects using the algorithms we've discussed in this section. Happy coding!
