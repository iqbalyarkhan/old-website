### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a type data structure called graph. We've already seen a type of a graph: binary search tree. Graphs can be used to model your data depending on the type of problem you have. Graphs do not have a rigid, well defined shape (unlike trees) and can be created to solve the problem at hand.

### Definitions

- **Vertices**: Similar to nodes in a tree, a vertex could represent a city in our graph.
- **Edges**: Edges connect 2 vertices together. An edge could represent a highway connecting cities.
- **Directed**: A directed graph is one that is represented by arrow heads showing the allowed direction that can be travelled.
- **Undirected**: Undirected graph allows you to travel in any direction (A to B or B to A) as long as the two vertices are connected.
- **Adjacent**: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they're connected (ie one edge away from one another)
- **Degree**: Degree of a vertex is the number of edges going into or out of (ie touch) a vertex

Here is what an undirected graph looks like:

![Undirected-Graph](images/graphs/undirectedgraph.png) [Image Credit - Undirected Graph](http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Graph/Internal_representation)

How would we go about representing a graph in our code? As you can notice, there is no defined structure. It is hard to determine what our left and right child is going to be for each node. To represent a graph in memory, we've got 2 methods: (the methods below are for undirected graphs)



### Adjacency Matrix

A matrix is nothing but a 2D array where the size of each array is equal to the number of vertices in our graph. A value of 1 at a particular index would mean that the vertex is connected to another vertex. A value of 0 would signify that no connection is present. So, for the above graph, a 1 at $(2,4)$ and $(4,2)$ would signify that 2 is connected to 4 and 4 is connected to 2. Let's create an adjacency matrix for the image above:


|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **4** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **5** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The matrix has a 2D array where each array is of size 5 (5 because our number of vertices are 5). Next, we see that 1 is connected to 4. Since this is an undirected graph, it also means that 4 is connected to 1. So, at indices $(1,4)$ and $(4,1)$ we can put a value of 1:


|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **4** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **5** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

4 is connected to 1,2 and 5. So we need to add 1s to the following positions:

$$$
(1,4) and (4,1) 
$$$

$$$
(2,4) and (4,2) 
$$$

$$$
(5,4) and (4,5) 
$$$

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
| **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| **4** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
| **5** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 

3 and 5 are connected:

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
| **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
| **4** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
| **5** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 

Finally, 2 is connected to 4 and 5:

|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 
| **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 
| **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
| **4** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
| **5** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 

### Adjacency Matrix code

```cpp{numberLines: true}
class AdjMatrix{
private:
    vector<vector<bool>> matrix;
    int vertices = 5;
    void InitAdjMatrix();
    
public:
    AdjMatrix();
    AdjMatrix(int);
    void AddEdge(int,int);
    void Print();
    
};

void AdjMatrix::Print(){
    for (int row = 0; row < vertices; row++){
        for (int col = 0; col < vertices; col++){
            cout << matrix[row][col] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

AdjMatrix::AdjMatrix(int numVertices) : vertices(numVertices){
    InitAdjMatrix();
}

AdjMatrix::AdjMatrix(){
    InitAdjMatrix();
}



void AdjMatrix::InitAdjMatrix(){
    matrix.resize(vertices);
    for (int row = 0; row < vertices; row++){
        matrix[row].resize(vertices);
    }
}

void AdjMatrix::AddEdge(int i, int j){
    matrix[i][j] = true;
    matrix[j][i] = true;
}
```

On lines 3 and 4:

```cpp{numberLines: 3}
    vector<vector<bool>> matrix;
    int vertices = 5;
```

we're declaring our matrix of type `bool` and the number of vertices in the graph. In the constructor, we call the `InitAdjMatrix` helper function. If number of vertices is not passed in by the user, we default to 5 vertices, otherwise we set it to whatever value was passed. 

```cpp{numberLines: 35}
void AdjMatrix::InitAdjMatrix(){
    matrix.resize(vertices);
    for (int row = 0; row < vertices; row++){
        matrix[row].resize(vertices);
    }
}
```
In this function, we are initializing our vector of vectors. First, we initialize the outer vector using the `matrix.resize(vertices)` call that takes in the number of vertices passed. The `resize()` function is used to resize the matrix once it has been declared. After this call on line 36, we've created our outer vector. Each element of this outer vector is also a vector so we need to initialize this inner vector as well. To do so, we loop through this outer vector and at each index, we call `resize()` again so that we initialize the inner vector. By default, a vector of booleans will be initialized to false. Once our initialization is complete, we've created a 2D vector of booleans. The client can then initialize the adjacency matrix and add edges as needed.

### Pros and Cons of Adjacency Matrix

**The good**
- Insertion and deletion is fast due to the fact that we can access any edge in $O(1)$ time. 
- Checking if two vertices are connected is also fast, $O(1)$ thanks to fast lookup using array indices.

**Tha bad**
- Notice in the matrix above, more than half the entries are $0$. Our matrix is a sparse matrix and requires $O(V^2)$ space where $V$ is the number of vertices. Therefore, if we have a large graph, a matrix would take up a lot of space  

### Adjacency List

An adjacency list also tells us what vertices are connected. As the name suggests, it is a linked list of connected items. For our image above, this is what the adjacency list would look like:

```
1 -> 4
2 -> 4 -> 5
3 -> 5
4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5
5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

```

### Adjacency List code

Let's see the code for constructing this undirected graph:

![Undirected-Graph](images/graphs/undirectedgraph.png) [Image Credit - Undirected Graph](http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Graph/Internal_representation)

```cpp{numberLines: true}
class AdjList{
private:
    int vectorSize;
    vector<vector<int>> adjList;
    vector<bool> visited;
    
public:
    AdjList();
    AdjList(int);
    void AddEdge(int,int);
    void Print();
    void AddVertex(int);
    void DeleteVertex(int);
    void DFS();
    void RecursiveDFS(int v);
    void MST();
};

void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList[v].size(); i++){
        int curr = adjList[v][i];
        if (!visited[curr]){
            RecursiveDFS(curr);
        }
    }
}

//Function that takes in the additional
//number of vertices that you want
void AdjList::AddVertex(int num){
    vectorSize+= num;
    adjList.resize(vectorSize);
}

//Function to delete vertex passed
void AdjList::DeleteVertex(int v){
    if (v > vectorSize)
        return;
    //Empties vertex v's adjacency list
    adjList[v].clear();
    //Looks through other adjacency lists and removes
    //v from those lists.
    for (int i = 0; i < vectorSize; i++){
        auto itr = adjList[i].begin();
        while (itr != adjList[i].end()){
            if (*itr == v){
                itr = adjList[i].erase(itr);
            } else {
                itr++;
            }
        }
    }
}

AdjList::AdjList(int vecSize) : vectorSize(vecSize + 1){
    cout << "Number of vertices was passed as: " << vectorSize << endl;
    adjList.resize(vectorSize);
    visited.resize(vectorSize);
}
AdjList::AdjList(){
    cout << "Number of vertices defaults to 5..." << endl;
    vectorSize = 6;
    adjList.resize(vectorSize);
    visited.resize(vectorSize);
}

void AdjList::Print(){
    for (int i = 0; i < vectorSize; i++){
        cout << i;
        for (auto j : adjList[i]){
            cout << " -> ";
            cout << j;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

void AdjList::AddEdge(int i, int j){
    adjList[i].push_back(j);
    adjList[j].push_back(i);
}

void AdjList::MST(){
    //Need an array to keep track of visited
    //nodes. All values will be initialized to 0
    vector<bool> visited(vectorSize);
    stack<int> elemStack;
    int curr = 0;
    elemStack.push(curr);
    while (elemStack.size() != 0){
        if (!visited[curr]){
            cout << curr << " ";
            visited[curr] = true;
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < adjList[curr].size(); j++){
            int neighbor = adjList[curr][j];
            if (!visited[neighbor]){
                elemStack.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        curr = elemStack.top();
        elemStack.pop();
    }
}

void AdjList::DFS(){
    //Need an array to keep track of visited
    //nodes. All values will be initialized to 0
    vector<bool> visited(vectorSize);
//    stack<int> elemStack;
    queue<int> elemStack;
    int curr = 0;
    elemStack.push(curr);
    while (elemStack.size() != 0){
        if (!visited[curr]){
            cout << curr << " ";
            visited[curr] = true;
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < adjList[curr].size(); j++){
            int neighbor = adjList[curr][j];
            if (!visited[neighbor]){
                elemStack.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        curr = elemStack.front();
        elemStack.pop();
    }
}

```
To create our list, we're using a vector of vectors declared on line 8. If you're using the default constructor, the number of vertices default to 5. So, if the default constructor is called, we'd have this:

```
0 -> <empty vector>
1 -> <empty vector>
2 -> <empty vector>
3 -> <empty vector>
4 -> <empty vector>
5 -> <empty vector>
```

Where 0-5 is one vector and each element in that vector is also a vector at that position. Note the use of `adjList.resize(vectorSize)` which is used to set the size of a vector after it is declared. We're using a vector because if we're given a vertex, say 4, we can access the adjacent vertices for 4 in $O(1)$ time. 

Since arrays and vectors start at 0 index, to keep consistent with the graph shown above, we'll add the 0th vector as well but will start adding at index 1. Next, when we call the `AddEdge()` function, we pass in the edge that needs to be created. So, when `AddEdge()` is called with 1 and 4, it performs the following actions:
```cpp{numberLines: 39}
void AdjList::AddEdge(int i, int j){
    adjList[i].push_back(j);
    adjList[j].push_back(i);
}
```

The function goes to the `adjList[1]` and pushes back 4 and conversely, goes to `adjList[4]` and pushes a 1. Since our graph is undirected, it means that if 1 is connected to 4, then 4 is also connected to 1. If it is a directed graph, we'd only add one edge instead of two. If it is a directed weighted graph, we can use `std::pair`. Once the connection is made, our vectors would look like this:

```
0 -> <empty vector>
1 -> <4>
2 -> <empty vector>
3 -> <empty vector>
4 -> <1>
5 -> <empty vector>
```

The process repeats until no more edges are to be added. We do not have a check in our `addEdge()` function to see if an edge already exists because we assume that the client will always pass in distinct edges. Notice how the vectors are only populated as needed ie there is no wasted space. 
 
Client code for this class:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    AdjList l;
    l.AddEdge(1,4);
    l.AddEdge(4,2);
    l.AddEdge(5,4);
    l.AddEdge(5,2);
    l.AddEdge(5,3);
    l.Print();
    return 0;
}

```
### Add Vertex

What if, after initialization, we realize we need to add more vertices to the graph? We want to add more vectors to the outer vector:

```cpp{numberLines: 18}
//Function that takes in the additional
//number of vertices that you want
void AdjList::AddVertex(int num){
    vectorSize+= num;
    adjList.resize(vectorSize);
}
```

In this function, we're first incrementing the private local variable `vectorSize` to the new size. It is expected the client will pass in the additional number of vertices to be added to our graph. For example, if our graph currently has 4 vertices and this function is called like so:`g.AddVertex(2)`,  we're to increase the graph size to 6. Therefore, we call the `resize()` function with this new updated size. Here is the sample client code and the corresponding output for the above calls:

```cpp
    AdjList l(4);
    l.AddEdge(0, 1);
    l.AddEdge(0, 2);
    l.AddEdge(0, 3);
    l.AddEdge(1, 2);
    l.AddEdge(2, 4);
    l.Print();
    l.AddVertex(3);
    cout << "After adding 3 more vertices: " << endl;
    l.Print();
```
output:
```
Number of vertices was passed as: 5
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 4
3 -> 0
4 -> 2

After adding 3 more vertices: 
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 4
3 -> 0
4 -> 2
5
6
7
``` 
### Delete Vertex

This function is a bit more complicated: we first need to remove the vertex from the outer vector and then we need to loop through each adjacency list for each other vector and remove that vertex from that adjacency list:

```cpp{numberLines: 19}
//Function to delete vertex passed
void AdjList::DeleteVertex(int v){
    if (v > vectorSize)
        return;
    //Empties vertex v's adjacency list
    adjList[v].clear();
    //Looks through other adjacency lists and removes
    //v from those lists.
    for (int i = 0; i < vectorSize; i++){
        auto itr = adjList[i].begin();
        while (itr != adjList[i].end()){
            if (*itr == v){
                itr = adjList[i].erase(itr);
            } else {
                itr++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we first call the `.clear()` function that completely removes the adjacency list for 2. This is the before and after results when `.clear()` is called for say, vertex 2:

Before
```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 4
3 -> 0
4 -> 2
```
After
```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 
3 -> 0
4 -> 2
```

Notice how 2 still exists in adjacency lists for 0,1 and 4. To remove those, we need to iterate through each vertex's list and find the item and remove it from that list. To do so, we use the following logic:

```cpp
    //Looks through other adjacency lists and removes
    //v from those lists.
    for (int i = 0; i < vectorSize; i++){
        auto itr = adjList[i].begin();
        while (itr != adjList[i].end()){
            if (*itr == v){
                itr = adjList[i].erase(itr);
            } else {
                itr++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Here we need to use the `erase()` call to delete the matched element in the vector and re-capture the iterator. Therefore, once this function returns, 2's adjacency list is empty (it is not technically removed but is good enough for our purposes) and no other vertex has the deleted item in its adjacency list.


### Pros and Cons of Adjacency List

**The good**
- Takes only as much space as needed: $O(E + V)$ where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices
- Allows for faster traversal: you only visit edges that exist.
- Time proportional to degree of a vertex to iterate through vertices adjacent to the said vertex
- Adding an edge takes $O(1)$ time
- Checking whether B is adjacent to A takes time $O(degree(A))$
- Time it takes to iterate through vertices adjacent to A = $O(degree(A))$

**The bad**
- Takes time to check whether two vertices are connected.
- Edge insertion and deletion also takes more time.

### Graph Search

One of the questions most frequently asked about graphs is some variant of the following:
- Is there a path from A to B?
- What is the shortest path from A to B? (Either in terms of number of hops, or distances or costs which may be stored on edges.)
- What is the distance from A to every other node in the graph (or every node that can be reached from A)?

All of these problems fall under the broad area of graph search or computation of shortest paths (or just paths). These problems have many important applications:

- Finding fast or cheap ways to go from one place to another, by utilizing road networks (optimizing distance or time), or airline or train networks (optimizing time or cost).
- Finding social distance in a social network.

A lot of real-world problems are extremely naturally modeled as shortest path searches in suitably defined graphs. There are plenty of follow up questions that can be asked when we're talking about graph search:

- Do we just want to know whether a path exists, or do we need to find it?
- If we need to find a path, do we want the shortest path, or will any path do?
- If we don’t need to find it, do we need the exact distance between nodes, or just whether a path exists? 
- Do edges have lengths/costs associated with them, or are we just interested in the number of hops.
- If edges have costs associated with them, can they be negative?

Let's start with an algorithm that'll help us answer the question **whether a path exists from A to B**:

### Depth First Search

The idea behind depth first search is to go as deep down a path as possible until you hit a dead-end and then backtrack your way to the next available path that can be taken. 

For example, if we have this undirected graph:

```

0-----3
|\
| \
|  \
1---2---4

```

The algorithm could print the following when the function, `DFS()` is called on it:

```
0 3 2 4 1
```

We start at 0, and push to stack its neighbors:

```
  3
  2  
  1
 ____
 stack

output: 0
```


Here is the code for DFS using a stack:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::DFS(){
    //Need an array to keep track of visited
    //nodes. All values will be initialized to 0
    vector<bool> visited(vectorSize);
    stack<int> elemStack;
    int curr = 0;
    elemStack.push(curr);
    while (elemStack.size() != 0){
        if (!visited[curr]){
            cout << curr << " ";
            visited[curr] = true;
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < adjList[curr].size(); j++){
            int neighbor = adjList[curr][j];
            if (!visited[neighbor]){
                elemStack.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        curr = elemStack.top();
        elemStack.pop();
    }
}
```

We use a stack to backtrack our way to the next available path that can be followed. The running time of DFS is $O(V + E)$. That is because we have to step through each vertex in our outer vector of the adjacency list:

```
0 --> <vector for 0>
1 --> <vector for 1>
2 --> <vector for 2>
3 --> <vector for 3>
4 --> <vector for 4>
```

and then for each vertex, we need to step through its edges which is represented by `<vector for index>`. Therefore, the total running time is $O(V + E)$. The approach above makes use of an extra stack which is extra space that is required. There is another recursive approach that runs with the same upper bound for time complexity and 0 extra space. This is made possible because we use an implicit call stack while making our recursive calls that allows us to backtrack:

```cpp{numberLines: 19}
void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList[v].size(); i++){
        int curr = adjList[v][i];
        if (!visited[curr]){
            RecursiveDFS(curr);
        }
    }
}
```

This function allows us to pass in any vertex you want and it'll print out all the vertices that can be reached from the passed vertex. The logic behind this function is this:
- Take in the passed vertex and mark the vertex in array, `visited` to true. This array is an [instance variable (bound to the instance of the class)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable) for the class. (If you want to use the test client to call `RecursiveDFS()` multiple times, you'd have to change the function signature and pass in this `visited` array on each recursive call by reference. Or have a helper function that clears the array first for each `RecursiveDFS()` function call.)
- Once the vertex is marked, print the vertex and iterate through the current vertex's adjacency list.
- In this list, if the `curr` vertex is not visited, call the function again with this new, un-visited vertex. 

### Finding Paths Using DFS

We've discussed algorithms for searching (BFS and DFS) but these algorithms can be modified slightly to answer more questions that we asked in the graph search section. Specifically, we're usually interested in answering questions such as **Is there a path from A to B and if so what is it?**. There is a surprisingly simple way to answer that question using DFS:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::RecursiveDFS(int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList[v].size(); i++){
        int curr = adjList[v][i];
        if (!visited[curr]){
            edgeTo[curr] = v;
            RecursiveDFS(curr);
        }
    }
}
```
Only addition we've made to DFS from earlier is that we've now got a new array called `edgeTo` which is equal to the size of the vertices in our graph (we initialized it in the constructor). Next, whenever we find an unvisited edge in a vertex's adjacency list, we're going to that index in the `edgeTo` array and populating that index with the value `v`. This helps us keep a note of what vertex we used to get to the current vertex, ie, what is the predecessor vertex to the current vertex that was used to get to the current vertex. Let's walk through an example:

Initially our `edgeTo` list is empty. Assume we've got 6 vertices labelled 0-5 in our graph:

```
edgeTo[0] = ___
edgeTo[1] = ___
edgeTo[2] = ___
edgeTo[3] = ___
edgeTo[4] = ___
edgeTo[5] = ___
``` 

and this is our graph:

![Undirected-Graph-1](images/graphs/path1.png) [Image Credit - Undirected Graph 1](https://graphonline.ru/en/)

and this is our adjacency list for the corresponding graph:

```
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5
1 -> 0 -> 2
2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
4 -> 2 -> 3
5 -> 0 -> 3
```

Let's say we start at vertex 0 so initially `edgeTo[0]` would equal 0. Next we look at 2 in 0's adjacency list so `curr` would equal 2. 2 is unvisited so we go inside the `if` statement in the function and mark `edgeTo[curr]` to `v`. `v` initially is 0 so `edgeTo[2] = 0`:

```
edgeTo[0] = ___
edgeTo[1] = ___
edgeTo[2] = 0
edgeTo[3] = ___
edgeTo[4] = ___
edgeTo[5] = ___
``` 
In essence, `edgeTo[curr] = v` means that the edge `v - curr` was taken (or `0 - 2` in the example above) to visit `curr` for the first time. When we're done with all the edges, this is what `edgeTo` would look like:

```
edgeTo[0] = 0
edgeTo[1] = 2
edgeTo[2] = 0
edgeTo[3] = 2
edgeTo[4] = 3
edgeTo[5] = 3
```

The `edgeTo` array allows us to capture the vertex that was taken to get to `edgeTo[curr]` vertex. How do we actually transform this information to something useful? For example, **what was the path taken to get to vertex 5 from vertex 0?** To do so, we need to follow the path information stored in `edgeTo` array. For example, to get to 5 (let's say 5 is our `w`) from 0 (let's say 0 is our `v`) we can step through the array like so:

```
Begin at the w vertex: 5
Check edgeTo[endVertex] = edgeTo[5] = 3.
Go to edgeTo[3] = 2
Go to edgeTo[2] = 0
We're now at v vertex: 0
```

This algorithm builds a path in time proportional to the number of vertices visited. Worst case, we need to go through all the vertices therefore the run time is $O(N)$.

Notice how in the algorithm above we've got the vertex trace but we need to print the trace in reverse order, ie last in first out: the algorithm went in this order`5 3 2 0` but the actual path we took was `0 2 3 5`. Since the nature of our output is LIFO, we can use a stack and keep pushing to our stack as we visit each vertex in the algorithm above:

```
Begin at the w vertex: 5 (push 5 on the stack)
Check edgeTo[endVertex] = edgeTo[5] = 3. (push 3 on the stack)
Go to edgeTo[3] = 2 (push 2 on the stack)
Go to edgeTo[2] = 0 (push 0 on the stack)
We're now at v vertex: 0

Stack:
  0
  2
  3
  5
_____

```

We can now pop elements off the stack and print them to get our actual path. Here's the code for this logic:

```cpp{numberLines:true}
void AdjList::FindPath(int v, int w){
    /**
     Begin at the w vertex: 5 (push 5 on the stack)
     Check edgeTo[w] = edgeTo[5] = 3. (push 3 on the stack)
     Go to edgeTo[3] = 2 (push 2 on the stack)
     Go to edgeTo[2] = 0 (push 0 on the stack)
     We're now at v vertex: 0
     */
    stack<int> s;
    int end = w;
    while (true){
        s.push(end);
        if (end == v){
            break;
        }
        end = edgeTo[end];
    }
    
    cout << "Path from " << v << " to " << w <<": "<<endl;
    while (!s.empty()) {
        cout << s.top() << " ";
         s.pop();
    }
    
    cout << endl;
}
```

### Breadth First Search

Notice how depth first search took a long route to find the path from 0 to 5 in the section above. That is because DFS is not designed to find the shortest route. It is used to find **a** route. Therefore, DFS helped us answer whether a path existed, BFS will help us find the shortest path from the starting node. 

In breadth first search, we start the search from elements closest to the starting node. The only difference between the code for depth first and breadth first is that breadth first uses `queue` instead of `stack`. The algorithm has 3 main steps:

- Remove a vertex from the queue
- Mark all vertices adjacent to current vertex and push them onto the queue
- Repeat until queue is empty

```cpp{numberLines: true}
void AdjList::BFS(int v){
    vector<int> marked(vectorSize);
    queue<int> q;
    marked[v] = true;
    q.push(v);
    while (!q.empty()){
        int curr = q.front();
        cout << curr << " ";
        q.pop();
        for (int i = 0; i < adjList[curr].size(); i++){
            int neighbor = adjList[curr][i];
            if (!marked[neighbor]){
                edgeTo[neighbor] = curr;
                marked[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```
 The code above first creates a boolean vector to keep track of visited elements called `marked`.
 
 We also create a queue to push elements so that we can visit them later. We want first in first out for breadth first search because we want to explore all the nodes closest to the starting node first. 

 Next we push the passed element, `v`, onto the queue and mark it. Then we enter a while loop until the queue is empty. 

 We pop an element off the queue, call it `curr`, and start to visit and mark all the elements that are adjacent to `curr`. In the process, we also go ahead and mark these adjacent vertices. This is because we're **visiting** them at this time and this is because BFS is interested in the vertices closest to the passed in vertex. At this point we also populate the `edgeTo` array to record how we got to the current vertex. 
 
We then push each one of these visited vertices onto the queue.   

Similar to DFS, the running time for BFS is also $O(V + E)$.

### BFS vs DFS
When do we choose one over the other? 

**BFS**
Helps us find all the vertices that are one edge away from the starting position, then 2 edges away and so on. BFS, therefore, is to be used when you're looking to find the shortest path to a vertex. 

**DFS**
Helps us actually answer the question whether a path exists between the vertices we're interested in.
