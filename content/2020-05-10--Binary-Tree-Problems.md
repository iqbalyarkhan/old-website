### Intro

A binary tree is a data structure that is useful for representing hierarchy. Formally a binary tree is either empty or a root node r together with a left binary tree and a right binary tree.

The depth of a node n is the number of nodes on the search path from the root to n, not including n itself. The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in that tree. A level of a tree is all nodes at the same depth.

A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. 

A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth, and in which every parent has two children. 

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.  

3 main types of traversals are: preorder, inorder and postorder.
