## What is [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in AWS Cloud. Using EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
