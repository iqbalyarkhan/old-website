### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a very common data structure called **stack**. Stack, as the name suggests, depicts the stack ADT. It means that elements are **stacked** on top of one another.

![Stack-Main-Image](./images/stacks/stackimage.png)

The image above shows the stack data structure. As the pointers show, the only operations we're concerned with in a stack are **push** and **pop**. Pushing on a stack means adding data to the top of our stack while popping means removing data from the stack. Due to this, a stack is a **LIFO** data structure: Last In, First Out. Let's have a look at some code on how to implement a stack and its common operations.

### Code

```cpp{numberLines:true}
#ifndef Stack_h
#define Stack_h

#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

template <typename T>
struct Node{
    Node<T>* next;
    T element;
};

template <typename T>
class Stack{
private:
    Node<T>* head;
    int size;
    
public:
    Stack();
    ~Stack();
    void Push(T elem);
    T Pop();
    int GetSize();
    void Print();
};

template <typename T>
Stack<T>::Stack(){
    size = 0;
    head = nullptr;
}

template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::Push(T elem){
    Node<T>* newItem = new Node<T>;
    newItem->element = elem;
    newItem->next = nullptr;
    if (size == 0){
        head = newItem;
    } else {
        newItem->next = head;
        head = newItem;
    }
    size++;
}

template <typename T>
T Stack<T>::Pop(){
    T poppedElement;
    if (size == 1){
        poppedElement = head->element;
        delete head;
    } else {
        Node<T>* curr = head;
        head = head->next;
        poppedElement = curr->element;
        delete curr;
    }
    size--;
    return poppedElement;
}

template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::Print(){
    Node<T>* temp = head;
    while (temp != 0){
        cout << temp->element << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

template <typename T>
Stack<T>::~Stack(){
    while (head != 0){
        Node<T>* temp = head;
        cout << "Deleting: " << temp->element << " ";
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
    }
    
    cout << endl;
}

template <typename T>
int Stack<T>::GetSize(){
    return size;
}
```

### Explanation

Similar to my [Linked List](/post/linked-lists/#code) implementation, I've created a template `Stack()` class. We can think of a stack as a linked list where the only operations allowed are add to front and remove from front. 

The code is pretty standard. It is clear that the insertion, or `Push()` method takes $O(1)$ time since all we're doing is creating a new node and adding it to the top of our stack.

Removal, or `Pop()`, takes $O(1)$ time as well since all we're doing is removing the element present at head, freeing up memory that was being used by that node, and then reassigning `head` pointer to the next element on stack.

### Dijkstra's Two Stack Algorithm

Let's look at a simple problem: Write a program to evaluate expressions such as $ {1+[(2+3)*(4*5)]} $. This is a simple arithmetic expression where we work our way out by evaluating inner-most expression. A simple algorithm, developed by Dijkstra, uses two stacks to solve expressions similar to the one shown above. The algorithm follows these steps:

- Ignore opening parenthesis: `{`,`[`,`(`
- If an operand is read, push to operand stack (stack one)
- If an operator is read, push to operator stack (stack two)
- If a closing (`}`,`]`,`)`)  parenthesis is read, pop two elements from the operand stack and the top element from operator stack and perform the relevant operation.
- Continue until both stacks are empty

#### Code

I'm assuming that the input expression is in the string format. With that in mind, here is the method that I wrote to evaluate the expression:

```cpp{numberLines: true}
template <typename T>
int Stack<T>::EvaluateExpression(string input){
    stringstream ss;
    char ch;
    ss << input;
    Stack<T> operatorStack;
    Stack<T> operandStack;
    int answer = 0;
    while (ss >> ch){
        if (isdigit(ch)){
            int elem = ch - '0';
            operandStack.Push(elem);
        } else if (ch == '*' || ch == '/' || ch == '+' || ch == '-'){
            operatorStack.Push(ch);
        } else if (ch == ']' || ch == '}' || ch == ')'){
            int elem1 = operandStack.Pop();
            int elem2 = operandStack.Pop();
            char sign = operatorStack.Pop();
            if (sign == '+'){
                answer = elem2 + elem1;
            } else if (sign == '-'){
                answer = elem2 - elem1;
            } else if (sign == '*'){
                answer = elem2 * elem1;
            } else {
                answer = elem2 / elem1;
            }
            operandStack.Push(answer);
        }
    }
    
    int itemsLeft = operatorStack.GetSize();
    while (itemsLeft > 0){
        int elem1 = operandStack.Pop();
        int elem2 = operandStack.Pop();
        char sign = operatorStack.Pop();
        if (sign == '+'){
            answer = elem2 + elem1;
        } else if (sign == '-'){
            answer = elem2 - elem1;
        } else if (sign == '*'){
            answer = elem2 * elem1;
        } else {
            answer = elem2 / elem1;
        }
        
        operandStack.Push(answer);
        itemsLeft--;
    }
    return operandStack.Pop();
}
```

#### Explanation
From lines `3 - 8` I'm declaring the stringstream that is to be used to process the input. We then declare our two stacks, the `operatorStack` for our mathematical operations and the `operandStack` the actual integers we'd be performing our operations on. 

Once we have that setup taken care of, we start reading the input character by character. On lines `10 - 13`:

```cpp{numberLines:10}
    if (isdigit(ch)){
            int elem = ch - '0';
            operandStack.Push(elem);
        } 
```

we check to see if the input is a digit using `isdigit` defined in `#include <ctype.h>`. You need to import `#include <ctype.h>` in your class to be able to use this method. If the character read is a digit, we convert to an integer and push it to our `operandStack`. 


Next, we check to see if the element is a symbol that represents a mathematical operation and if so, we push that symbol to the `operandStack`:

```cpp{numberLines:13}
    else if (ch == '*' || ch == '/' || ch == '+' || ch == '-'){
            operatorStack.Push(ch);
    }
```

Finally, in the final `else if` we check to see if we've encountered a closing brace. If so, we pop the two operands from our `operandStack` and the operator from our `operatorStack` and perform the necessary operation. Finally, after the operation is done, we push the result back on to the `operandStack`:

```cpp{numberLines:15}
    else if (ch == ']' || ch == '}' || ch == ')'){
            int elem1 = operandStack.Pop();
            int elem2 = operandStack.Pop();
            char sign = operatorStack.Pop();
            if (sign == '+'){
                answer = elem1 + elem2;
            } else if (sign == '-'){
                answer = elem1 - elem2;
            } else if (sign == '*'){
                answer = elem1 * elem2;
            } else {
                answer = elem1 / elem2;
            }
            operandStack.Push(answer);
    }
```

This process is continued until we've encountered the last closing brace after which we check to see if the stacks are empty. If not, we continue to perform the steps above until the stacks are empty.

As an example, let's assume that we had to evaluate this expression:

$$10*[ (4 + 5) * ( 13 - 12) ]$$ 

First, we encounter the 10, and push it to our `operandStack`:

```
    10
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```
Next, we encounter the multiplication sign and push to our `operatorStack`:

```
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Then, we ignore the two opening braces: "[" and "(". We then push 4 to `operandStack`, the addition symbol to `operatorStack` and again the integer 5 to `operandStack`:

```
    5
    4                   +
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```
Now comes the fun part: we encounter a closing brace, ) , at which point we pop two elements from `operandStack`, a single element from the `operatorStack`:

```

                        
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

and perform the operation based on the operator we popped from the `operatorStack`:

`4 + 5`. 

We then push the result back to our `operandStack`:

```

    9                    
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```
Next, we continue reading from our string and find a multiplication symbol:

```

    9                   * 
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Next we ignore the opening brace, push 13 to `operandStack`, push the subtraction sign to `operatoStack` and push 12 to `operandStack`:

```
    12
    13                  -
    9                   * 
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Now, we encounter a closing brace, ), so we pop two elements from the `operandStack` and a single element from the `operatorStack`. We then perform the operation based on the popped element from the `operatorStack`, and push the result back to `operandStack`:

```cpp

13 - 12 = 1

```

```
    
    1                 
    9                   * 
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Next we get another closing brace, ], so we pop and push our operation's result:

```
    
             
    9                   
    10                  *
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Now, we're done with the closing braces and there is no more input to process. However, we still have elements on both stacks. So, while `operatorStack` is not empty, repeat the calculation and pushing process:

```
    
             
                       
    90                  
____________        _____________
operandStack        operatorStack
```

Notice, our final answer is the only item that remains on the `operandStack` which we return from the function.

### Balanced Parenthesis Check

A problem similar to what we discussed in the previous section is one that checks whether an expression has balanced parenthesis. 
Again, we'll take advantage of the stack class we wrote to verify a given string. Our sample string could look like:

`[{()}]{([])}` 

and we're to check whether this is valid. In the example above, we should return true.

The logic is quite simple. I've written a function in our `Stack` class called `isValid(string input) that looks like this:

```cpp{numberLines}
template <typename T>
bool Stack<T>::isValid(string input){
    stringstream ss;
    char ch;
    ss << input;
    Stack<T> inputStack;
    while (ss >> ch){
        if (ch == '[' || ch == '{' || ch == '('){
            inputStack.Push(ch);
        } else if (ch == ']') {
            char popped = inputStack.Pop();
            if (popped != '[')
                return false;
        }else if (ch == '}') {
            char popped = inputStack.Pop();
            if (popped != '{')
                return false;
        }else if (ch == ')') {
            char popped = inputStack.Pop();
            if (popped != '(')
                return false;
        }
    }
    
    if (inputStack.size != 0){
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

The logic is quite simple: If we encounter an opening brace, we push it to on our stack. If a closing brace is read, we pop an element from our stack and compare whether it is the corresponding opening brace. If so, we continue, otherwise, we break immediately and return false. 

### Print in Reverse

Another simple use case for a stack: given a string, print it in reverse order. Obviously, there are better methods to do so using just a for loop but this is a good exercise to understand how stacks work:

```cpp{numberLines}
template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::PrintStringInReverse(string input){
    stringstream ss;
    char ch;
    ss << input;
    Stack<T> inputStack;
    while (ss >> ch){
        inputStack.Push(ch);
    }
    
    while (inputStack.GetSize() > 0){
        cout << inputStack.Pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

The code above is quite self explanatory: it will take in a string, push it to our `inputStack` and then print out elements as they're popped off the stack. This would result in our string being printed in reverse order.


### Intro

- For most problems (unless explicitly asked), you can use C++ STL Stack using `#include <stack>`.
- Stacks support these operations:
    - **push(e)**: pushes a new element on the stack
    - **pop()**: removes the top element BUT doesn't return it
    - **top()**: returns top element BUT doesn't remove it
    - **empty()**: returns true if stack is empty
- Stacks are useful when you need to parse an input or somehow reverse its order. 

### Evaluate postfix expression
**Given a postfix expression, evaluate and return the value representing the expression**

Example: 34+2*1+ = 15

The logic is quite simple: if you encounter a digit, push to stack, if you encounter an operator, pop top 2 from stack, perform the relevant operation and push the result back on stack. 

Running time is $O(N)$ where $N$ is the length of the string.

```cpp
int convert(string in){
    stack<int> s;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < in.size(); i++){
        char ch = in[i];
        if (isdigit(ch)){
            s.push(ch - '0');
        } else {
            int A = s.top();
            s.pop();
            int B = s.top();
            s.pop();
            
            if (ch == '+')
                ans = B + A;
            else if (ch == '-')
                ans = B - A;
            else if (ch == '*')
                ans = (B*A);
            else
                ans = (B/A);
            
            s.push(ans);
            
        }
    }
    
    return ans;
}
```

Be careful with the order of operations. For example,if you get this: 62/ you'd be doing 6/2 = 3. So make sure your order is correct when you pop and perform the calculation. In the code above, when you pop, you pop 2 (which becomes `A`) first and then 6 (which becomes `B`). So you can't do `A/B`, since that would be 2/6 = 0. You want 6/2 so we do B/A.

### Valid Parens

**Given a string, check if it has valid parenthesis**

Example: 
[{()}] is valid
[{)] is not valid

```cpp{numberLines: true}
bool isValid(string s){
    stack<char> parens;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
        char curr = s[i];
        if (curr == '(' || curr == '{' || curr == '['){
            parens.push(curr);
        } else {
            if (parens.empty())
                return false;
            char topL = parens.top();
            parens.pop();
            if (topL == '(' && curr == ')'){}
            else if (topL == '{' && curr == '}'){}
            else if (topL == '[' && curr == ']'){}
            else
                return false;
        }
    }
    
    if (parens.empty())
        return true;
    
    return false;
}
```

The solution is quite simple, if it is an opening brace, push to stack, if it is a closing brace, pop from stack and make sure the read brace and the popped brace match. Also, I've used a simpler if else statement that does nothing if the conditions match (since conditions that are valid are fewer than conditions that are invalid). This results in cleaner and shorter code. 

Running time: $O(N)$ where $N$ is the size of the string. Space complexity is also $O(N)$ for the stack. 

### Implement Max functionality

**Design a stack that includes a max operation, in addition to push and pop. The max method should return the maximum value stored in the stack.**

It is easy to think that we can just keep track of the max element in the stack. But how would you update the max once we pop an item off the stack?

```cpp
push 4:


  4  
_____   
stack   max = 4

push 9:

  9
  4  
_____   
stack   max = 9

pop:

  
  4  
_____   
stack   max = ??
```

One approach is to keep popping elements off the stack, figure out the new max and then put those items back and return the new max. This approach would take $O(2N) \approx O(N)$ time to pop elements off and then put them back in the right order. It takes $O(1)$ space. This is quite slow if you have a lot of elements on your stack.

A better approach is to maintain 2 stacks. `mainSt` to keep track of all `push` and `pop` operations and a `maxStack` to keep track of every max we've seen so far. Let's see how this would work:

- If the max stack is empty, push the new element onto the max stack
- If a new element pushed to main stack is greater than the top of the max stack, push this new element to the max stack as well. Otherwise do nothing with the max stack
- If an element popped from the main stack is same as the element top of the max stack, pop from the max stack as well.

```cpp
push 4:


  4         4  
_____   ________
stack   max stack

push 9:

  9         9
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack

pop:

  
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack

push 12:

  12        12
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack

push 5:

  5
  12        12
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack

push 14:
  14
  5         14
  12        12
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack

pop
  
  5         
  12        12
  4         4
_____   _________
stack   max stack
getMax() -> 12
``` 


Here's the `maxStack` class:

```cpp
class MaxStack{
private:
    stack<int> maxStack;
    stack<int> mainStack;
    
public:
    void push(int x){
        mainStack.push(x);
        if (maxStack.empty()){
            maxStack.push(x);
        } else {
            int currMax = maxStack.top();
            if (currMax < x)
                maxStack.push(x);
        }
    }
    
    void pop(){
        if (mainStack.top() == maxStack.top()){
            maxStack.pop();
        }
        mainStack.pop();
    }
    
    int top(){
        return mainStack.top();
    }
    
    void peekMax(){
        cout << "Max: " << maxStack.top() << endl;
    }
    
    int popMax(){
        int max = maxStack.top();
        maxStack.pop();
        return max;
    }
};
```

### Sunset view

**You are given with a series of buildings that have windows facing west. The buildings are in a straight line, and any building which is to the east of a building of equal or greater height cannot view the sunset.
  Design an algorithm that processes buildings in east-to-west order and returns the set of buildings which view the sunset. Each building is specified by its height.**
  
One approach is to store the heights of all the buildings in an array and then start from the last index, keep track of max and determine which buildings have a view. This requires $O(N)$ space and $O(N)$ time where $N$ is the number of buildings.

A better approach uses less space. Say, here're our buildings:

```cpp
        WEST          EAST
SUN ->  2, 10, 4, 12, 8
```

We start from the east end so we get the first value, `8`. We record it:

```cpp
   
8     
```

Next, we get a 12. 12 > 8 meaning 12 would prevent 8 from viewing the sunset, so 8 can no longer see the sunset but 12 can, so remove 8 and add 12:

```cpp
   
12    
```

Next, we get a 4. 4 is not > 12, so just add 4 to the list as well since 4 can also see the sunset:

```cpp
   
4
12    
```

Next, we get a 10. 10 > 4, so 4 cannot see the sunset, keep removing elements from the list until you find an element > 10 and then add 10 to the list.

```cpp
   
10
12    

As of now, only 2 buildings can see the sunset, 10 and 12.
```

Next, we get a 2. 2 is not greater than 10, so 2 can also see the sunset, add it to the list:

```cpp
2
10
12    
```

We're done: we've got 3 buildings that can see the sunset: 2,10 and 12. Notice the order: we're eliminating buildings based off the height of the building we just received: ie LIFO. The list can be stored in a stack! 

```cpp
void ProcessInput(stack<int>& s, int h){
    if (s.empty()){
        s.push(h);
        return;
    }

    while (!s.empty() && h > s.top()){
        s.pop();
    }
    s.push(h);
    return;
}

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    stack<int> buildings;
    int height = 0;
    while (height != -1){
        cout << "Enter building height: ";
        cin >> height;
        if (height == -1)
            break;
        ProcessInput(buildings, height);
    }
    
    while (!buildings.empty()){
        cout << buildings.top() << " ";
        buildings.pop();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Running time is same as brute force $O(N)$ but space complexity is $O(1)$ in the best case where we get heights in increasing order.

### Daily Temperatures
**Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.**

Example:
```cpp
T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

A simple brute force solution is quite easy to see: you start at index 0 and keep moving forward until you find a temperature higher than that at index 0. You record the difference in the answer array. You repeat the same for index 1, index 2 and so on. This would take $O(N^2)$ time and constant space. 

A faster approach is possible but with use of extra space! We're being asked to find the next largest integer closest to a given integer. It is clear that we can't get this info in constant time if we go from left to right. We'd have to start at the higher end of the array. 

Ok, so as we make our way from right to left, what information do we keep track of? We want to keep track of the largest integers. Let's step through the example above:
We'll use `i` as our pointer for elements:

At the current iteration, we see the stack is empty, we'll simply push the element and its index to the stack. We'll leave the answer array as is:

```cpp
                                  i  
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  0]

stack: 73,7
```

We'll then decrement the pointer:


```cpp
                              i      
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  0]

stack: 73,7
```

Now, we see that the stack does have an item on it BUT it is less than the current item. We'll go ahead and pop that item from stack since it is clear that for subsequent items, the closest next largest integer would NOT be 73 BUT 76 since 76 > 73. We'll then push 76 to the stack and decrement `i`. We'll leave the answer array as is:

```cpp
                         i      
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  0]

stack: 76,6
```

Now, we're at `72`. We check the stack and find the element on stack IS greater than 72. We simply subtract the index of 76 from current index and put that value in the answer array:

```cpp
                         i      
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  0,  1,  0,  0]

stack: 76,6
```

Now, the question is, do we push 72 and its index to the stack? YES! That's because we might find a integer in future iterations that's smaller than 72, say 69. So, for 69, the next largest element is 72 and NOT 76, so we'll push 72 along with is index to the stack as well and decrement `i`:


```cpp
                      i      
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  0,  1,  0,  0]

       72,5 
stack: 76,6
```

Now, for 69, we find the next largest on stack so we get the difference, update the answer array and push 69 to the stack as well:

```cpp
                  i      
T   [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
ans [0,   0,  0, 0,  1,  1,  0,  0]

       69,4
       72,5 
stack: 76,6
```

And so on.... This process continues until `i` becomes less than 0. Running time for this solution is $O(N)$ and space is also $O(N)$. Here's the code for this logic:




### Conclusion

- Stacks can be quite handy when attempting to solve a certain type of problem where the order of elements is important.
- Usually, a complex problem can be solved by using 2 stacks instead of 1.
