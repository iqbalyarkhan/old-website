### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a fundamental data type in C++ called pointers. To understand pointers in C++, we must understand how a program makes use of memory in C++. Each byte of memory in a computer has a unique address associated with it that increases as we move along. If our first byte has address 201, the next byte would have address 202. A boolean variable is saved in 1 byte of memory, so a boolean can occupy the address 201:
 
 ```

bool b;
int i;

    b  |---- i -------|
    __  __  __  __  __  __  __  
    201 202 203 204 205 206 207
<--                           -->
```
 
 
 Usually, an integer variable takes up 4 bytes of memory. So, if we declare an int, it can be saved at address 202-205. To remember where these variables are saved, a computer has a lookup table that would have 2 entries: `bool b 201` and `int i 202`. When these variables are initialized, their binary representation take up the allocated bytes in memory.
 
 How do we access or operate on the addresses of these variables? To do so, we use pointers:
 
 ### Pointers
 
 A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. Let's say, we've got this memory diagram so far:
 
  ```
 
 bool b = false;
 int i = 5;
 
     0  |---- 5 -------|
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207
 <--                           -->
 ```

At address 201, we've got a boolean variable stored and at addresses 202-205 we've got an integer saved. Let's say we declare a pointer to an integer:

```cpp
int* p;
```

This syntax means that `p is a pointer to an integer`. Next, we need to initialize `p` to some value. Since pointers store addresses, we need to save the address of an integer in this variable `p`:

```cpp
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
```

Now, `p` stores the address of integer i (`&` is the `address of` operator). Let's say our pointer is stored at address 207-210 (pointers also need space to be stored just like an int, bool or char would):

  ```
 
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
 
     0  |---- 5 -------|     |------ p ----|
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __   
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210
 <--                                         -->
 ```

Since `p` is holding the address of an integer, our memory diagram would look like this:

  ```
 
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
 
     0  |---- 5 -------|     |----- 202 ---|
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __   
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210
 <--                                         -->
 ```

If you print p, you'd get the address stored in p:

```cpp
 
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
cout << p << endl; //prints 202
```

To get to the actual value in `p`, you'd have to dereference p:

```cpp
 
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
cout << p << endl; //prints 202
cout << *p << endl; //prints 5
cout << &p << endl; //prints 207
```

You can also change the value being pointed to by `p`:

```cpp
 
bool b = false;
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
*p = 10; //Changing 5 to 10
cout << p << endl; //prints 202
cout << *p << endl; //prints 10
cout << &p << endl; //prints 207
```

### Pointer to Pointer

If you really want to get fancy, you can have a pointer to pointer as well. This means that we can have a pointer that stores the address of another pointer:

```
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
 
        |---- 5 -------|     |------ p ----|
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __   
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210
 <--                                         -->
 ```

Let's say, we have a pointer to a pointer called `q`, that'll store the address of p. To declare `q`, we use this syntax: `int** q;`: 

```
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
int** q;
q = &p;
 
        |---- 5 -------|     |------ p ----|
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __   
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210
 <--                                         -->
 ```

So, now, if `q` is stored at address 220, this is what our memory diagram would look like:


```
int i = 5;
int* p;
p = &i;
int** q;
q = &p;
 
        |---- 5 -------|     |-- p = 202 --|              |-- q = 207 --|  
     __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __  __ ..... __  __  __  __  __    
     201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 .... 220 221 222 223 224 
 <--                                         -->
 ```

So here is what we have now:
- `int i`
- pointer to int `p`: `int* p`
- pointer to pointer to an int: `q`: `int** q`

### Heap

In C++, you can create dynamic memory using the `new` keyword and access it via a pointer. For example, let's say we've got an integer pointer:

```cpp
int* arr;
```

`foo` needs to point to the address of an integer. We can declare an array of integers and have `foo` point to the first element in that array. It is technically correct to do so since we're saving the address of the first integer in that array in our `foo` variable. To do so, we need to declare this new dynamically allocated array using the `new` keyword. Unlike static arrays, size of a dynamic array can be declare at run time:

```cpp
int* arr;
arr = new int[5];
```
What we've done here is that we've asked the `new` operator to reserve a block of contiguous memory on the heap equal to the size of 5 integers. Then, return the address of the start of that block. We then capture that address in our variable called `arr`. Our memory diagram would look like this:

```

___ ___ ___ ___ ___ 
 |
arr 

```

We can then access each element of the array like so:

```cpp
int* arr;
arr = new int[5];
arr[0] = 1;
arr[1] = 2;
arr[2] = 3;
arr[3] = 4;
arr[4] = 5;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
```

`arr[0]` would access the first dynamically allocated integer spot in the array and so on. Saying `arr[0]` is the same as saying `*(arr)`, `arr[1]` is the same as saying `*(arr + 1)` and so on. Incase your `new` operator call is not able to find memory on heap for some reason, you can catch it like so:

```cpp
char* c = new (std::nothrow) char[100];
if (!c) {
  // Handle error...
} else {
  // Do something with the new memory...
}
```

Once done with the array, we'd have to explicitly call the `delete` function on it:


```cpp
int* foo;
foo = new int[5];
// do something with the array,
// then delete it:
delete[] foo;
```

### Smart Pointers

We can make use of smart pointers that'll handle the creation of the said pointer and freeing of memory once we're done with it. This will ensure that we don't leak memory in our C++ programs. Smart pointers are defined in the header called `memory`. Below, we discuss various types of smart pointers.

#### Unique Pointers  

As the name suggests, unique pointers are pointers that point to unique objects: an object reference cannot be copied over from one unique pointer to another. Unique pointers are scoped pointers: as they go out of scope they're automatically deleted and the memory the unique pointer is pointing to is automatically deallocated. This is why unique pointers have to point to unique objects and copying of unique pointers is not recommended. Let's have a look at a unique pointer in action: 

```cpp{numberLines: true}
#include <memory>

class Book{
private:
    string title;
public:
    Book(){
        cout << "Constructor called! " << endl;
    }

    void SetTitle(string t){
        title = t;
    }

    string GetTitle(){
        return title;
    }

    ~Book(){
        cout << "Destructor called! " << endl;
    }
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    cout << "About to enter scope" << endl;
    {
        unique_ptr<Book> ptr = make_unique<Book>();
        ptr->SetTitle("My new title!");
        cout << ptr->GetTitle() << endl;
    }
    cout << "Exited the scope" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
We've created a class of type Book that has 4 simple methods. Next, in main, we've initialized our `unique_ptr` inside a scope and assigned it the Book object. We then call the set and get title and then the scope exits. When the scope exits, `unique_ptr` will automatically handle the freeing up of memory for us as demonstrated by this output when you run the program:

 ```text
About to enter scope
Constructor called! 
My new title!
Destructor called! 
Exited the scope
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

You can't copy a unique pointer to another unique pointer or pass a unique pointer to a function.

#### Shared Pointers

Unlike unique pointers that are freed when they go out of scope, shared pointers are not deleted for us until all references to that pointer are deleted. To do so, behind the scenes, reference counting is used. For example, if I had a shared pointer pointing to an object and I make a copy of the shared pointer and then the original one goes out of scope, my shared pointer would still be able to access the object. Let's have a look:

```cpp
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    cout << "About to enter scope" << endl;
    shared_ptr<Book> b2;
    {        
        shared_ptr<Book> b1 = make_shared<Book>();
        b1->SetTitle("Shared pointer book");
        cout << b1->GetTitle() << endl;
        b2 = b1;
        cout << "use count inside the scope: " <<b2.use_count() << endl;
    }
    
    cout << "Exited the scope" << endl;
    cout << b2->GetTitle() << endl;
    cout << "use count outside the scope: " <<b2.use_count() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

We used the same Book class as above but this time, we used 2 shared pointers. The `use.count()` method allows us to check the number of elements that are using this shared pointer. Once that number goes down to 0, the shared pointer's destructor is called:

```text
About to enter scope
Constructor called! 
Shared pointer book
use count inside the scope: 2
Exited the scope
Shared pointer book
use count outside the scope: 1
Destructor called! 
Program ended with exit code: 0
```
