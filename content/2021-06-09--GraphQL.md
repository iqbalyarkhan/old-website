## Introduction

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It can even be deployed within an IDE known as GraphiQL. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call.

### GraphQL and Github

To get started, let's use Github's GraphQL API for which you need to generate a personal access token. The access token allows you to read and write data with your username.

There are two common ways to interact with the GitHub GraphQL API:

- First, you can use [GitHub’s GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer). You only need to sign up with your GitHub account to run GraphQL queries. This is what we'll be using.
- Second, you can use a generic client called `GraphiQL`. It allows you to run GraphQL queries against your github account using the token you generated.

## Query

```graphql
#keyword
query {
  #object
  viewer {
    #field1
    login
    #field2
    url
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "login": "iqbalyarkhan",
      "url": "https://github.com/iqbalyarkhan",
      "avatarUrl": "https://xyz.com/u/123"
    }
  }
}
```

Example above starts with keyword `query`. This is similar to `select` statement in SQL. Inside the query, we provider the `viewer` object that can be used to request data about the currently authorized user. Since you are authorized by your personal access token, it should show data about your account.

The viewer is an `object` in GraphQL terms. Objects hold data about an entity.

This data is accessed using a so-called `field` in GraphQL. Fields are used to ask for specific `properties` in objects. For instance, the viewer object exposes a wide range of fields. Two fields for the object–name and url–were used in the query.

To specify a GitHub organization, you can pass an `argument` to fields. In the example below, I've provided `login` as an argument:

```graphql
query {
  organization(login: "SMUCSEG2Consulting") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "SMUCSEG2Consulting",
      "descriptionHTML": "<div></div>",
      "url": "https://github.com/SMUCSEG2Consulting"
    }
  }
}
```

What if you're part of 2 organizations? Simply add 2 queries right?

```graphql
query {
  organization(login: "SMUCSEG2Consulting") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
  organization(login: "SMUCSE2341") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
}
```

output: You’d see an error such as `Field 'organization' has an argument conflict`.

That's because you're requesting 2 objects with the same structure. If you ever wanted to request data about two identical objects, you would have to use `aliases` because GraphQL wouldn’t know how to resolve the two organization objects in a result. Here's how you'd do it. (Note the use of `consulting` and `teaching` as aliases):

```graphql
query {
  consulting: organization(login: "SMUCSEG2Consulting") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
  teaching: organization(login: "SMUCSE2341") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "consulting": {
      "name": "SMUCSEG2Consulting",
      "descriptionHTML": "<div></div>",
      "url": "https://github.com/SMUCSEG2Consulting"
    },
    "teaching": {
      "name": "CS 2341 - Data Structures",
      "descriptionHTML": "<div>Github Org for SMU's Data Structures Class</div>",
      "url": "https://github.com/SMUCSE2341"
    }
  }
}
```

### Fragments

Note how we repeated the same fields(name, descriptionHTML and url) over and over in the query above:

```graphql
query {
  consulting: organization(login: "SMUCSEG2Consulting") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
  teaching: organization(login: "SMUCSE2341") {
    name
    descriptionHTML
    url
  }
}
```

We can extract commonly used fields into something called a `fragment`. Fragment specifies 2 pieces of information:

- What fields should form the query
- What type of object can the fragment be used on

Here's how you define a fragment

```graphql
fragment nameOfFragment on nameOfObject {
  field1
  field2
}
```

Now converting our 3 fields into a fragment we get:

```graphql
fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

We can now change our query to:

```graphql
query {
  consulting: organization(login: "SMUCSEG2Consulting") {
    ...sharedOrgFields
  }
  teaching: organization(login: "SMUCSE2341") {
    ...sharedOrgFields
  }
}

fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

### Variables

In the previous queries, you provided arguments that identified an organization to your fields; but you **inlined** these arguments in your query. Think about a query like a function, where it’s important to provide dynamic arguments to it. That’s where the `variable` in GraphQL comes in: it allows arguments to be extracted as variables from queries. Here’s how an organization’s login argument can be extracted to a dynamic variable (let's use a single organization for now):

```graphql
query ($organization: String!) {...}
```

We've provided name of the variable, `organization`, to our query via the `$` sign. We're also providing the **type** of variable which is `String`. Exclamation point `!` means that the argument is required.

Here's the previous example in its entirety using variables (I removed the alias since there's only 1 org now):

```graphql
query ($organization: String!) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    ...sharedOrgFields
  }
}

fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

To pass in the variables, you'd do so in the query variables section:

```json
{ "organization": "SMUCSE2341" }
```

### Default Variables

What if you have a field that can be provided in some cases and omitted in others? You can use a default variable. To do so, simply make the variable non-required (by removing exclamation) and provide a default value:

```graphql
query ($organization: String = "SMUCSE2341") {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    ...sharedOrgFields
  }
}

fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

### Named Queries

What if you had multiple queries? To keep things clean, we can also name our queries:

```graphql
query getOrgInfo($organization: String = "SMUSCE2341") {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    ...sharedOrgFields
  }
}

fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

### Nested Objects

So far we've only looked at organization info. Let's find out the repos owned by an org. An org has another field called `repository` that can disply info of the repo name passed in.

Let's pass in the repo's name dynamically. Let's remove the default args and make org name and repo name required:

```graphql
query getOrgInfo($organization: String!, $repository: String!) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    ...sharedOrgFields
    repository(name: $repository) {
      name
    }
  }
}
fragment sharedOrgFields on Organization {
  name
  descriptionHTML
  url
}
```

with the following query variables:

```json
{ "organization": "SMUCSE2341", "repository": "Sprint4Headers" }
```

will return this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "CS 2341 - Data Structures",
      "descriptionHTML": "<div>Github Org for SMU's Data Structures Class</div>",
      "url": "https://github.com/SMUCSE2341",
      "repository": {
        "name": "Sprint4Headers"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Directives

A directive decorates part of a GraphQL schema or operation with additional configuration. Tools like Apollo Server (and Apollo Client) can read a GraphQL document's directives and perform custom logic as appropriate.

Directives are preceded by the @ character, like so:

```graphql
type ExampleType {
  oldField: String @deprecated(reason: "Use `newField`.")
  newField: String
}
```

This example shows the `@deprecated` directive, which is a default directive (i.e., it's part of the GraphQL specification). It demonstrates the following about directives:

- Directives can take arguments of their own (reason in this case).
- Directives appear after the declaration of what they decorate (the `oldField` field in this case)

Let's use this directive concept with our repository. We'll pass a directive called `withFork` that'll determine if we want to get the `forkCount` for a particular repo. If it's true, we'll display this count, otherwise we won't.

This line determines this logic inside the `repository` object:

```graphql
forkCount @include(if: $withFork)
```

An example:

```graphql
query getOrganizationInfo(
  $organization: String!
  $repository: String!
  $withFork: Boolean!
) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    descriptionHTML
    repository(name: $repository) {
      name
      forkCount @include(if: $withFork)
    }
  }
}
```

Here're the variables we provide to our query:

with the following query variables:

```json
{
  "organization": "SMUCSE2341",
  "repository": "Sprint4Headers",
  "withFork": true
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "CS 2341 - Data Structures",
      "url": "https://github.com/SMUCSE2341",
      "descriptionHTML": "<div>Github Org for SMU's Data Structures Class</div>",
      "repository": {
        "name": "Sprint4Headers",
        "forkCount": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Mutations

Lets talk about `mutation`: unlike `query`, a `mutation` is used for writing data instead of reading it. The `mutation` shares the same principles as the `query`: it has `fields` and `objects`, `arguments` and `variables`, `fragments` and operation names, as well as directives and nested objects for the returned result. With mutations you can specify data as fields and objects that should be returned after it "mutates" into something acceptable.

Let's check out the documentation for `addStar` mutation:

As arguments it accepts `AddStarInput!`. `AddStarInput` needs these as input:

```graphql
#Required  Starrable ID to star.
starrableId: ID!

#Optional unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.
clientMutationId: String
```

This means you need to have the `starrableId` of the repo that you want to star. To do so, I need to query one such repo:

```graphql
query getRepoId {
  organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    repository(name: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "The Road to React",
      "url": "https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react",
      "repository": {
        "id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzM1MjkwNw==",
        "name": "the-road-to-learn-react"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We'll now use the returned ID to create a mutation to like this repo:

```graphql
mutation starRepoWithID($repoID: ID!) {
  addStar(input: { starrableId: $repoID }) {
    starrable {
      id
      viewerHasStarred
    }
  }
}
```

In the mutation above, we have defined return fields as the `starrable` object. We provide this as our query variables:

```json
{ "repoID": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzM1MjkwNw==" }
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addStar": {
      "starrable": {
        "id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzM1MjkwNw==",
        "viewerHasStarred": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To un-star, we'll do this:

```graphql
mutation unStarRepoWithID($repoID: ID!) {
  removeStar(input: { starrableId: $repoID }) {
    starrable {
      viewerHasStarred
    }
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "removeStar": {
      "starrable": {
        "viewerHasStarred": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Imagine you have a list of repositories in your GitHub organization, but you only want to retrieve a few of them to display in your UI. It could take ages to fetch a list of repositories from a large organization. In GraphQL, you can request paginated data by providing arguments to a list field that says how many items you are expecting from the list:

```graphql
query OrganizationForLearningReact {
  organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    repositories(first: 2) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`first` argument is passed to the `repositories` list field that specifies how many items from the list are expected in the result. The query shape doesn’t need to follow the `edges` and `node` structure, but it’s one of a few solutions to define paginated data structures and lists with GraphQL.

We still need to figure out how to fetch the next two repositories in the list, however. The first result of the query is the first page of the paginated list, the second query result should be the second page.

Each edge comes with its own cursor field to identify its position in the list:

```graphql
query OrganizationForLearningReact {
  organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    repositories(first: 2) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
        cursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

output:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "The Road to React",
      "url": "https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react",
      "repositories": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "the-road-to-learn-react"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOA8awSw=="
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "hackernews-client"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOBGhimw=="
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now, you can use the cursor of the first repository in the list to execute a second query. By using the after argument for the repositories list field, you can specify an entry point to retrieve your next page of paginated data:

```graphql
query OrganizationForLearningReact {
  organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    repositories(first: 2, after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOA8awSw==") {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
        cursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the previous result, the second item is retrieved, as well as a new third item. The first item isn’t retrieved because you have used its cursor as after argument to retrieve all items after it.

## Schema

So far we've been using a schema that's already defined. It is the schema exporsed by Github. We'll now see how to create our own schema. Your GraphQL server uses a schema to describe the shape of your available data. This schema defines a hierarchy of types with fields that are populated from your back-end data stores. The schema also specifies exactly which queries and mutations are available for clients to execute.

The GraphQL specification defines a human-readable schema definition language (or SDL) that you use to define your schema and store it as a string.

Here's a short example schema that defines two object types: `Book` and `Author`:

```graphql
type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}
```

A schema defines a collection of types and the relationships between those types. In the example schema above, a `Book` can have an associated `author`, and an `Author` can have a list of `book`s. Note that the schema is not responsible for defining where data comes from or how it's stored. It is entirely implementation-agnostic.

Most of the schema types you define have one or more fields:

```graphql
# This Book type has two fields: title and author
type Book {
  title: String # returns a String
  author: Author # returns an Author
}
```

Each field returns data of the type specified. A field's return type can be a `scalar`, `object`, `enum`, `union`, or `interface`. Let's look at each one:

### Scalar Types

Scalar types are similar to primitive types in your favorite programming language. They always resolve to concrete data.

GraphQL's default scalar types are:

- Int: A signed 32‐bit integer
- Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value
- String: A UTF‐8 character sequence
- Boolean: true or false
- ID (serialized as a String): A unique identifier that's often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache.

Although it's serialized as a String, an ID is not intended to be human‐readable. These primitive types cover the majority of use cases.

### Object Types

Most of the types you define in a GraphQL schema are object types. An object type contains a collection of fields, each of which has its own type.

Two object types can include each other as fields, as is the case in our example schema from earlier:

```graphql
type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}
```

### Enum Types

An enum is similar to a scalar type, but its legal values are defined in the schema. Here's an example definition:

````graphql

```enum AllowedColor {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
````

An enum can appear anywhere a scalar is valid (including as a field argument), because they serialize as strings:

```graphql
type Query {
  favoriteColor: AllowedColor # enum return value
  avatar(borderColor: AllowedColor): String # enum argument
}
```

A query might then look like this:

```graphql
query GetAvatar {
  avatar(borderColor: RED)
}
```

### Union Types

When you define a union type, you declare which object types are included in the union:

```graphql
union Media = Book | Movie
```

A field can have a union (or a list of that union) as its return type. In this case, it can return any object type that's included in the union:

```graphql
type Query {
  allMedia: [Media] # This list can include both Book and Movie objects
}
```

All of a union's included types must be object types (not scalars, input types, etc.). Included types do not need to share any fields. The following schema defines a `SearchResult` union type that can return either a `Book` or an `Author`:

```graphql
union SearchResult = Book | Author

type Book {
  title: String!
}

type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Query {
  search(contains: String): [SearchResult!]
}
```

GraphQL clients don't know which object type a field will return if the field's return type is a union. To account for this, a query can include the subfields of multiple possible types.

Here's a valid query for the schema above:

```graphql
query GetSearchResults {
  search(contains: "Shakespeare") {
    # Querying for __typename is almost always recommended,
    # but it's even more important when querying a field that
    # might return one of multiple types.
    __typename
    ... on Book {
      title
    }
    ... on Author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Every object type in your schema automatically has a field named `__typename` (you don't need to define it). The `__typename` field returns the object type's name as a String (e.g., Book or Author).

GraphQL clients use an object's `__typename` for many purposes, such as to determine which type was returned by a field that can return multiple types (i.e., a union or interface). Apollo Client relies on `__typename` when caching results, so it automatically includes `__typename` in every object of every query.

This query uses inline fragments to fetch a `Result`'s title (if it's a `Book`) or its name (if it's an `Author`).

To fully resolve a union, Apollo Server needs to specify which of the union's types is being returned. To achieve this, you define a `__resolveType` function for the union in your resolver map.

The `__resolveType` function is responsible for determining an object's corresponding GraphQL type and returning the name of that type as a string. It can use any logic to do so, such as:

Checking for the presence or absence of fields that are unique to a particular type in the union
Using instanceof, if the JavaScript object's type is related to its GraphQL object type
Here's a basic `__resolveType` function for the SearchResult union defined above:

```graphql
const resolvers = {
  SearchResult: {
    __resolveType(obj, context, info){
      // Only Author has a name field
      if(obj.name){
        return 'Author';
      }
      // Only Book has a title field
      if(obj.title){
        return 'Book';
      }
      return null; // GraphQLError is thrown
    },
  },
  Query: {
    search: () => { ... }
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`)
});
```

If a `__resolveType` function returns any value that isn't the name of a valid type, the associated operation produces a GraphQL error.

### Interface Types

An interface specifies a set of fields that multiple object types can include:

```graphql
interface Book {
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}
```

If an object type `implements` an interface, it must include all of that interface's fields:

```graphql
type Textbook implements Book {
  title: String! # Must be present
  author: Author! # Must be present
  courses: [Course!]!
}
```

The following schema defines a Book interface, along with two object types that implement it:

```graphql
interface Book {
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Textbook implements Book {
  title: String!
  author: Author!
  courses: [Course!]!
}

type ColoringBook implements Book {
  title: String!
  author: Author!
  colors: [String!]!
}

type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
}
```

In this schema, Query.books returns a list that can include both Textbooks and ColoringBooks. If a field's return type is an interface, clients can query that field for any subfields included in the interface:

```graphql
query GetBooks {
  books {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

Clients can also query for subfields that aren't included in the interface:

```graphql
query GetBooks {
  books {
    # Querying for __typename is almost always recommended,
    # but it's even more important when querying a field that
    # might return one of multiple types.
    __typename
    title
    ... on Textbook {
      courses {
        # Only present in Textbook
        name
      }
    }
    ... on ColoringBook {
      colors # Only present in ColoringBook
    }
  }
}
```

As with union types, Apollo Server requires interfaces to define a \_\_resolveType function to determine which implementing object type is being returned.

Here's an example \_\_resolveType function for the Book interface defined above:

```graphql
const resolvers = {
  Book: {
    __resolveType(book, context, info){
      // Only Textbook has a courses field
      if(book.courses){
        return 'Textbook';
      }
      // Only ColoringBook has a colors field
      if(book.colors){
        return 'ColoringBook';
      }
      return null; // GraphQLError is thrown
    },
  },
  Query: {
    books: () => { ... }
  },
};
```
