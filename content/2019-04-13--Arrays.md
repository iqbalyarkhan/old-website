### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a simple data structure called array (or vector). An array is nothing but a contiguous section of the memory where we can store homogeneous data. Since it is contiguous, we can access elements in an array via subscript notation in $O(1)$ time.

To copy a vector to another vector, you can do:

```cpp
vector<int> a = {1,2,3,4};
vector<int> b = a;
```

This would be a deep copy.

### Dutch Flag

```cpp
Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into the array.
Return the array in the order such that elements less than A[i] appear
before A[i] and elements greater than A[i] appear after A[i].
```

The idea is simple: move, the pivot to the beginning of the array. Start one pointer, `i` at index 1, another, `j` at index size - 1. Keep swapping elements of the two pointers until  `i` and `j` cross over. Then swap pivot with `j`.

```cpp
void DutchFlag(vector<int>& A, int index){
    int pivot = A[index];
    A[index] = A[0];
    A[0] = pivot;
    int i = 1;
    int j = A.size() - 1;
    while (i < j){
        while (A[i] < pivot && i < j)
            i++;
        while (A[j] > pivot && i < j)
            j--;
        
        if (i == j)
            break;
        
        int temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[j];
        A[j] = temp;
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    
    A[0] = A[j];
    A[j] = pivot;
    
}
```
