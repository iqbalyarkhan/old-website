### Introduction

In this post I'll talk about a simple data structure called array (or vector). An array is nothing but a contiguous section of the memory where we can store homogeneous data. Since it is contiguous, we can access elements in an array via subscript notation in $O(1)$ time.

To copy a vector to another vector, you can do:

```cpp
vector<int> a = {1,2,3,4};
vector<int> b = a;
```

This would be a deep copy.

### Dutch Flag

```cpp
Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into the array.
Return the array in the order such that elements less than A[i] appear
before A[i] and elements greater than A[i] appear after A[i].
```

The idea is simple: move, the pivot to the beginning of the array. Start one pointer, `i` at index 1, another, `j` at index size - 1. Keep swapping elements of the two pointers until  `i` and `j` cross over. Then swap pivot with `j`.

```cpp
void DutchFlag(vector<int>& A, int index){
    int pivot = A[index];
    A[index] = A[0];
    A[0] = pivot;
    int i = 1;
    int j = A.size() - 1;
    while (i < j){
        while (A[i] < pivot && i < j)
            i++;
        while (A[j] > pivot && i < j)
            j--;
        
        if (i == j)
            break;
        
        int temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[j];
        A[j] = temp;
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    
    A[0] = A[j];
    A[j] = pivot;
    
}
```

This is well and good if there's only 1 value of the pivot present. For example, the above would fail if your input array was something like this:

```cpp
{0,1,2,-1,2,1,5,2,1}
```

and the pivot was 1. To solve it, you need a better approach. Here's the best approach:

Think of the array as having 4 sections:

```cpp
small -> goes from 0 till S-1
equal -> goes from S till eq
unexplored -> goes from i till large
large -> from large + 1 till size -1 
```

Basically what we're doing is shrinking the unknowns from right if value found is larger and from the left if value found is smaller than the pivot. START WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE CERTAIN OF. You're trying to find what values are bigger or smaller BUT you're certain that the middle ones will stay between small and large.

Easiest way to figure out how to approach this is to look at the array when our array is like so:

```cpp
             s      eq      l             
0   -1  -2   1  1   ?   ?   ?   4   6   2       

```

Now, you want to see what `eq` is equal to. It can be:
 
**(1) less than the pivot**:

```cpp
             s      eq       l             
0   -1  -2   1  1   -3   ?   ?   4   6   2       

In this case, we need to swap eq with s and increment eq and s:

                 s       eq  l             
0   -1  -2   -3  1   1   ?   ?   4   6   2   

Notice now, everything less than s is less than the pivot: [0,s)
Everything between [s,eq) is equal to pivot  
Everything between [eq,l] is unexplored
Everything greater than l is greater than the pivot: (l, size-1]
```

**(2) greater than the pivot**:

```cpp
             s      eq       l             
0   -1  -2   1  1   7    ?   ?   4   6   2

Here, you need to swap l with eq and decrement l ONLY:

             s      eq       l             
0   -1  -2   1  1   ?    ?   7   4   6   2

That is because we've swapped an unknown with eq. 
That unknown could be less than, equal to or greater than the pivot 
so we can't move eq BUT we're 100% certain that the newly discovered
item is > pivot so we can decrement l
```

**(3) equal to the pivot**: we just move eq to the right

**POINT TO NOTE**

- Try the above with `s` not pointing to one greater than the smallest element but AT the smallest element
and see how you get errors when you start out your iteration when eq and s both point to the first element which is smaller than the pivot. 

So, this is how it is right now: (with pivot being 1)

```cpp
          s 
[-1,-2,-3,1,1,1,4,5,6]

```

If you have this:

```cpp
        s 
[-1,-2,-3,1,1,1,4,5,6]
```

There'll be A LOT of headache and ugly code!

Usually if you find yourself writing ugly code, try moving the boundaries. Like I did above, I moved the `s` boundary to smallest + 1 index. That way, even if my first element is smaller than the pivot, I don't need to make special modifications or add extra checks to the algorithm

### Plus One
**Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list,
 and each element in the array contain a single digit.
You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.**

This is a simple one. The only trick is that if you're given a 999 and you add 1 to make it a 1000, what would you do since you're out of space in the array? Well:

```cpp
999
000
```

That isn't right, so you need to change the first element to 1 and push_back a 0:

```cpp
999
1000
```
```cpp
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        int i = int(digits.size()) - 1;
        bool carry = true;

        while (i >= 0){
            int curr = digits[i];
            if (carry){
                curr += 1;
                if (curr == 10){
                    digits[i] = 0;
                } else {
                    digits[i] = curr;
                    carry = false;
                }
            }
            i--;
        }

        if (carry){
            digits[0] = 1;
            digits.push_back(0);
        }

        return digits;
    }
```

Also, for other similar questions, if the number is too large, converting it to an integer and then performing some operation might not be feasible. So the best approach is to keep the integer in the array and perform operations on it.
