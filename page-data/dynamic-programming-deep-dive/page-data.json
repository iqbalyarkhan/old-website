Before we deep dive let's see what types of problems can be solved using DP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recursive problems with overlapping structures. This means, any problem in the <a href=\"/recursion\">recursion</a> post that has substructure where we're solving already solved subproblems (factorial, subset sum, common subsequence, common substring, min insertions and deletions, stair case et).</li>\n<li>DP programming can also be used to solve problems where solutions are built on top of previously derived solutions.
